    <p><b>Jupiter</b> is the largest planet in our solar system, known for its prominent bands of clouds and the Great <span style="color: red;">Red</span> Spot, a massive storm larger than <span style="color:green;">Earth</span>. It is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere that features high-speed winds and complex weather patterns. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: <i>Io</i>,<i> Europa</i>, <i>Ganymede</i>, and <i>Callisto</i>.

    Its immense size and gravitational pull play a significant role in shaping the solar system's dynamics.Among its 79 moons, the Galilean moons are particularly notable. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, Europa may harbor a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, Ganymede is the largest moon with its own magnetic field, and Callisto features a heavily cratered surface.
    As missions like NASA's Juno explore Jupiter, we deepen our understanding of gas giants and their influence on the solar system's formation and evolution.</p>

    <ol>
    	<li><strong>Great Red Spot:</strong> A massive storm that has been raging for at least 350 years, larger than Earth, showcasing Jupiter's dynamic atmosphere.</li>
        <li><b>Strong Magnetic Field:</b> Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's, creating intense radiation belts.</li>
        <li><b>Fast Rotation:</b> It has the shortest day of all the planets, rotating once approximately every 10 hours, which contributes to its flattened shape at the poles.</li>
        <li><b>Many Moons: </b>Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, with the four largest—<i>Io, Europa, Ganymede,</i> and<i> Callisto</i>—collectively known as the Galilean moons.</li>
        <li><b>Ring System:</b> While not as prominent as Saturn’s, Jupiter has a faint ring system made up of dust particles and small rocks, primarily located near its equator.
